# WebsiteCollections.Playground
This is a web app I created to experiment with new tools and technologies that I haven't used before. 
The version in the main branch will be the most generic version, 
and each version using different technologies will be in a different branch.
This is an unusual use of branching, but it makes it easy to compare the differences between each version.
